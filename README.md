Java Functional Interfaces

Hi, 'planetai'! This is a plain boring repository of Java, where I am placing my learnings of Java Functional Programming. Feel free to check around, maybe even fork
and push your learnings on it. Or just hop into another repo, I won't mind. 

I am learning from [Amigoscode](https://amigoscode.com/), a really fun and interactive place to learn Java.
